# Realtime demos

This folder contains realtime demonstrations that make use of the python $\verb+pyaudio+$ module.

Demonstrations:

* amod.py - Multiplies the incoming audio by a sine wave of a constant frequency
* pitchup.py - Shifts audio pitch up
* pitchdown.py - Shifts audio pitch down
* bitcrush.py - Removes precision from each sample of the incoming audio, creating harmonics and a percieved 'bit-crushed' effect.
* vader.py - Uses bit crushing and pitch shift down in conjunction to make a person's voice sound a little bit like Darth Vader from Star Wars
